  <h2> Django Application with MARIADB </h2>
  <p> Django is a Python Backend Framework which abstracts the database layer, which means it you only write the Model codes once, and Djago translates to the major database internally </p>
  <p> This is a simple Content Management System, and the configuration of the MARIADB is found in the settings.py file </p>
  <p> To make such connection, other important packages were also installed, as you would see in the Pipfile </p>
